###Exploring Identity
For this module we have been looking at identity and personal branding. So far we have studied monograms and how we can combne our initials to make a recognisable symbol or logo for our personal own brand.

###Experimental Work
Below you can see some of the experimental monograms I played with before I picked my final one. 

###Circular Monogram
With this monogram I wanted it to be simple and clear but versatile at the same time. The circular shape gives it the ability to be adapted in many ways. Below you can see I have put it inside a hot air baloon but this shape is flexible enough to put into different objects such as an eye or a lightbulb for example.

Another idea I had with this monogram is that I could incorporate weather. This gives the shape a fun twist and I if it was on a web page for example it could be programmed to show the weather for that day in a ceratin location.

###Mayan Monogram
With this monogram I took inspiration from my love of ancient history and used maya glyphs and lettering to encourage the design. I created different patterns using the monogram and used a bright colour scheme. I like the overall look of this monogram but I feel it doesn't really go with my personality.
